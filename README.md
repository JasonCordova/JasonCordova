Hi, my name is Jason Cordova. I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science from the New Jersey Institute of Technoloy (NJIT).

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for Backend Development and Quality Assurance. I'm currently expanding my skills, contributing to projects, and always excited to learn something new.

Thanks for stopping by, it's nice to meet you!
